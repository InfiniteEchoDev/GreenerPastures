Made in 48 hours for Town One 2023, which had the theme "**Strength in Numbers**".

## Features
* Lots and lots of sheep!
* Hungry wolves who can be defeated with enough numbers!
* A dynamic soundtrack that builds as you get more sheep

## How to play
Guide Seph using the keyboard or gamepad. Shep has a **flock radius** that attracts sheep.

Avoid the wolf until you gather enough sheep. Once you're ready to go all out, **whistle** to send your flock to rush towards the wolf and sheep-pile it to submission.
